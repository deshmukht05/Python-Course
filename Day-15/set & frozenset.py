# Set in Python is a set of values.
# It does not support indexing.
# Hence, it is unordered collection of items.
# In set, every element is unique (no duplicates allowed).
# Python allows adding or removing items in set.
# It is mainly used to perform mathematical set opreations like union, inertsection, difference, symmetric difference etc.
# Python set is written in curly brackets.
# Being unindexed, set do not support element position or order.
# Python supports twi built in set types: 
# 1. set - this is mutable
# 2. frozenset - this is immuatable and hashable
# The set and frozenset, both support set to set comparison.
# Instances of set is compared with instances of frozenset based on their members.
# In case of binary operations that mix set and frozenset instance, Python returns type of the first operand.
