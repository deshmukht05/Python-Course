# An exception is a logical error occurs at run time i.e. during execution of a program.
# Note that syntax error occurs at compile time and is due to poor knowledge of languages syntax.
# Mainly exceptions are due to poor understanding of the logic or poor coding practice.
# Python supports several built-in exceptions that causes process to stop and passes it to calling process to handle and otherwise forces program to output an error.
# Occurance of an exception is an event at run time that disrupts the normal flow of program instructions and creates an exception object.
# The exception is the base class for exceptions.
