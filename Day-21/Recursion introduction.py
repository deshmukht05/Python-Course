# Recursion is the process of calling recursive function.
# Recursion function is a type of function that deals with itself.
# It is like parellel image that reflects image of image recursively.
# Function calls itself until some condition stop it.
# Such function is called base condition or base criteria or base case.
# If base condition does not met then function cals itself infinitely.
# It is necessary that in every recursive call, function argument must tends to base criteria.
# Usually all function whoes logic can be described in decreasing order can write using recursion.
# About recursion, note that (pluses and minuses):
# 1. It is always called explicitly by some external code.
# 2. It makes code neat and clean.
# 3. Easier to write.
# 4. Reduces lines of code.
# Using recursion, complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-programs.
# When base condition is met, it returns some constant and exit from function.
# Sequence generation in recursion is easier than using nested iteration.
# It consumes more memory.
# Sometimes it is hard to debug, like as the function calls itself it is too difficult to understand which call is causing the issue.
# Sometimes it it difficult to  follow path of recursion.
# Every logic cannot write using recursion.
