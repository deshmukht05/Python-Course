# Functions: 
# Functions is like a module that divides program into smaller piece which is a set of logically related statements to perform a specific task.
# Module in programming language are functions, subroutines, procedures or subprograms.
# It is a structuring element that can be defined once and used more that once, when and where required.
# When program become larger, it is convenient to use functions that makes program easy for organization and debugging.
# Function avoids repetitions of code and provides facility of reusability.
# Functiona can pass data called parameter and also can return data as result of function.
# Functions which are in-built in language are called built-in functions.
# User may require to define new functions as per program logic requirement, called user-defined function.
# Functions performs only one operation i.e. to call the functionality.
# Note that function definition is an executable statement.
# Function definition does not execute the function body.
# Function body is executed when function is called.
# A function definition may be wrapped by one or more decorator expression which are evaluated when the function is defined in the scope that contains the function definition. (Decorator is a function returning another function)
# When the function definition is executed, defualt parameter values are evaluated from left to right.
# Once function is defined, we can call it from another function or program or pythob prompt.
# For calling function, just type the function name with required arguments.
