# Introduction to matrix operations.
# The + operator is used to add corresponding elements of two NumPy arrays.
# The * opporator is used for array multiplication i.e. to multiply corresponding elements of two arrays. (this is not matrix multiplication)
# The dot() method is used for matrix multiplication, provided that size of matrices must be compatible for multiplication i.e. number of columns in first matrix msut be same as number of rows in second matrix.
# The transpose() method is used to find transpose of given matrix.
