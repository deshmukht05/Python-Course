# Inheritance:
# This is the mechanism of deriving new class from the existing class.
# This maintains the hierarchy of classes. 
# The inherited class (newly derived class) inherits the attributes and methods of the class from which it is derived. 
# Existing class which is used to derive new class is called superclass or the parent class or base class.
# Newly derive class is called as subclass or heir class or child class or derived class. 
# Superclass is the ancestor of derived class. 
# Python has a built-in base class called object. Hence when other in-built or user-defined class defined is ultimately inherits from it. 

# Syntax: 
# class base_class:
#       pass
# class derived_class(base_class):
#       pass

# Statement pass in syntax can be replaced with actual class definition. 
# In child class definition, the name of parent class appeards in parantheses. 
# It is important that the base class and derived class must be defined in the same scope. 
# Inheritence provides facility of reusability of code as it allow to customize the behavior of parent class without modifying it. 
# It makes program easy to understand. 
# Inheritance reflects "is-a" relationship among classes.
