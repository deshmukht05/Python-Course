# Multi-Level inheritance:
# This is a process of deriving a class from another derived class.
# Let B is the base class and D1 is derived from B. If we derive another class D2 from D1 then it became a multilevel inheritance.
# D1 is derived for B and base for D2. Hence D1 can be referred as intermediate base class.
